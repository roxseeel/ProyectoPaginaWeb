Video Title: Metabolic Diseases
Language: English

00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:01.880
Basic Transcription:

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.840
Metabolic diseases are disorders 
that alter the way 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.640
the body obtains and uses energy. 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.160
These diseases may be caused 
by genetic factors, 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.920
hormonal changes, or unhealthy habits such as 
poor diet or lack of exercise. 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280
They affect vital functions such as 
digestion, fat storage, and 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.760
blood sugar regulation.
Understanding them is essential to prevent them.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.440
Diabetes mellitus:
One of the most 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.840
common metabolic diseases is diabetes mellitus.
In this condition, the body cannot properly regulate 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.440
blood glucose levels due to a lack or improper 
use of insulin. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.240
If not controlled, it can cause damage 
to the eyes, kidneys, and heart.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.960
Obesity: 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.920
Obesity occurs when there is an 
excessive accumulation of body fat. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.120
This happens because of an imbalance between 
the energy we consume and the energy we use. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.404
It also increases the risk of developing 
diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

00:00:58.404 --> 00:00:59.000
Hypothyroidism:
Hypothyroidism occurs when 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920
the thyroid gland does not produce 
enough hormones. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.480
This slows down metabolism, 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.560
causing fatigue, weight gain, and 
a constant feeling of cold.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.360
Dyslipidemias:
Dyslipidemias are characterized by increased 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.560
levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in the blood.
Over time, these fats can accumulate 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.800
in the arteries, restricting blood 
flow and increasing the risk of heart attack.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.200
Risk Factors:
Although some metabolic 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.840
diseases have a genetic origin, many 
are related to lifestyle. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.080
A diet high in sugars 
and fats, lack of exercise, 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.400
stress, and lack of sleep are 
factors that increase the risk. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.520
Adopting healthy habits can make 
a big difference in prevention.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.080
Prevention:
The best way 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.440
to prevent metabolic diseases 
is to maintain a balanced diet, 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.080
rich in vegetables, fruits, and healthy proteins.
It is also important to exercise 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.920
regularly, sleep well, and attend 
regular medical check-ups. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.760
Small changes can have 
a great impact on your health.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.360
In conclusion, metabolic 
diseases can be prevented. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.640
Taking care of your body with good habits is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.760
the key to maintaining a healthy 
metabolism and a longer, fuller life. 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.640
Remember: taking care of your 
metabolism is taking care of your health.
